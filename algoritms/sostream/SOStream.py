        SOStream - Self Organizing Density-Based Clustering over Data Stream.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha: float, optional
            The scale factor that brings neighbors closer to the winning
            cluster.
        min_pts : int, optional
            The minimum number of neighbors.
        merge_threshold : float
            The fusion threshold.

        Attributes
        ----------
        M : array, shape = n_samples x n_clusters
            List composed of lists of microclusters that are created each
            time t.
